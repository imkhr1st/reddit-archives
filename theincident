## Some Background

**You can skip this if you want, skip to ---> [The Incident](#the-incident)**

I am a 19-year-old turning 20 soon, in the midst of switching professions. I have had frequent nightmares for my entire life. This is not something that has just increased recently. I have easily over 100 dreams I can recall if I tried, and they are all nightmares—no memorable pleasant dream in my entire life. I have had dozens of dreams filled with warfare, isolation, almost being killed, bombs being dropped on my school, walking around the corner of a city street after the dropping of a thermo-nuclear bomb.

I have also had many dreams involving what you might call claustrophilia (a term I use for enjoying confined spaces). Usually, these took place in my grandfather's house, in the vents, or somewhere else while hiding from something or someone in the house.

## Bad Hobbies

I have recently been overworking myself, which is quite a habit when I'm working passionately. I have been getting 0 hours of sleep per day and only getting sleep when my body crashes itself, in which I don't even notice myself falling asleep.

I have been drastically employing my expertise to cut down on anything I consider bad for my psyche. This includes:
- Ad blockers for sites with frequent inappropriate ads
- Removing explore pages
- Using a unified DM to open socials
- A unified messenger with images turned off to prevent NSFW content
- Turning off all short-form content and making it so that without explicitly searching on YouTube, I would see a blank screen

Additionally, I removed all color-hacking psychology and made all the icons on my PC plain white, as I have heard it increases productivity. I did the same to my phone and reverted it back to almost a dumb phone.

It has helped a lot. I have even noticed being paralyzed (not really) by expecting the old option of information overload.

## Background

As I mentioned, I have had frequent nightmares since childhood and even learned to enjoy them to a degree. I convinced myself it was normal and just moved on.

For reference (not meant to break [Rule 3: Spiritual/Mystical Content]), around the age of 15-16, I tried to astral project with my cousin. For those who don't know, this is supposed to be an arcane technique where you put your body to sleep while staying fully conscious and then "pull" your spirit out of your body. We both lay down close to each other with the same tape supposed to lead us into astral projection. He claims it worked, and what he describes I felt too—only the "White Space" and "Loud Ringing" that I was supposed to hear before astral projection. After this happened three times in a row, I chickened out and started screaming in this space, trying to move until I awoke. I won’t claim any surreal experience, as I’ve never had one and will never try again.

## The Incident

Tonight, I was looking up subliminal content as I reviewed some past studies on them and came across a dozen forum posts, videos, etc., discussing the topic. I decided to give it a try. What could happen, right? I searched for a while and got bored. I ended up clicking on a 432Hz | "RICH! You are a money magnet!" track. I then reclined back in my chair, as I have admittedly been unable to catch a Z in my bed at night.

I had some really vivid dreams, all related to current stressful situations with my family and financial matters. Some were not good at all. It almost seemed as if my subconscious was trying to agree with these things and bring them to fruition, as if it felt they would somehow improve my situation. In reality, while they probably would, that gives no green light for such actions [nothing as terrible as you're thinking—relax]. It was near the height of these things, and I felt myself trying to wake up. I could not move, but I was very conscious. My eyes were flashing open, and I saw the flickering glimpses of my monitors and PC to my left. I tried to scream, but it was like 5 layers of tape were on my mouth. I was trying to scream for help but was conscious enough to think about holding off so no one would see my screen as I partook in this weird child’s experiment. Even though I say I was conscious, I would attribute it to more like what drunkenness would feel like. Even though I have never experienced it myself, I have put the glasses on in high school if that counts for anything. As I continued to attempt violent movements and screaming, it felt like I finally broke through. I moved, although the imagined movement was a violent kick that shook my desk and sent my PC flying to stop this horrendous audio. The reality was a toddler's kick that softly hit the extension cord next to my feet.

## Previous Experiences

I believe I have had around 2-3 other experiences of sleep paralysis in my life, and they have all, or at least 2 of them, been induced by sound. I can’t exactly pinpoint the sound, but it was most likely some type of phonk one time and I believe a gospel song the other. I won’t describe the paralysis again, as the experience was exactly the same as the previous ones, although you could say it was quite a bit more frightening since I was going into it having experienced it 3 prior times. I also felt as if I was in a much more comfortable position this time, as my arms were pinned to my body and my armpits weren’t exposed. I had Gargalaphobia (fear of being tickled) as a child, so this could be why those other experiences were much more frightening. It also felt like, after breaking through in each instance, I had a seizure as I felt my body violently shaking. This wasn’t imagination, as I stopped myself as soon as I had bodily control.

## Uncanny Coincidence [Sorry again, Rule 3]

Not to be mystical, but as some added fluff to this story: As mentioned above, I was listening to a 432Hz frequency, and a couple of minutes later while searching forums for previous experiences, I noticed the clock was 4:34—kind of uncanny.

The other thing was, around this time, I heard a loud voice say "Bro" when I realized I was still in a Discord call as my friend continued to rant about his almost psychedelic paralysis experience, which was the first he had ever had. The timing freaked me out for a bit, even though I won’t think too much of it.

## Concern

My previous research told me this was the transition between wakefulness and sleep, specifically during the REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep stage. During REM sleep, the body experiences atonia, which is a natural state of muscle paralysis meant to prevent us from acting out our dreams. Sleep paralysis happens when the brain wakes up from REM sleep but the body remains in the atonia state, resulting in a temporary inability to move or speak while being conscious.

Do you all think this should just be ignored, or, as a previous forum member suggested, might it be worth bringing up to my doctor?

Thanks for any responses to this prolonged word vomit.
